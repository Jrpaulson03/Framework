# Framework
Framework is an older project that I developed for use in previous jobs before the era of .NET Core. It comprises my customized versions of several commonly used tools, which I employed in-house when more common tools were not suitable. Although I have since moved on, I believe this project serves as a testament to my coding abilities.
